The past few projects that I’ve made are either voluntary work, projects for a client, or school projects. I’ve been waiting to make a website for myself for the longest time, now I’ve had finally done it.

Yay!

But now my back is hurting.

And it’s because I made the critical mistake of **not using Tailwind,** and my poor back is definitely paying for it.

Just posting this so I do not have a blank _posts_ page on my site, and also to mark this moment as a tiny milestone for myself. Stay tune for a detailed post on how I build my portfolio!
